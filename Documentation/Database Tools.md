## Database Tools

### RazorSQL:
* RazorSQL is an extensive suite of tools that will help you run a relational database that is accessed with SQL. The suite is able to communicate with a long list of RDBMSs, including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Informix, and Ingres.
* The interoperability of the tool is particularly useful if you have to deal with several database types on your site. The SQL command set is not exactly the same for all RDBMSs, so you can waste time entering the wrong command format when you switch from one system to another. RazorSQL presents a GUI interface, which it then interprets into commands that get executed in the database. However, if you want to write your own scripts, the utility includes an SQL Editor, which will highlight syntax errors.

### MySQL Workbench:
* All of the utilities of MySQL Workbench are accessed through a unifying visual interface. If you are creating a new database, you start off with the Entity-Relationship Diagram creation tool in the package. The detail screens on this diagram enable you to define all of the requirements for the objects in the database.
* The SQL Editor supports the object creation tasks of your database creation project. The Editor presents color-coding for statements and clauses, helping you see immediately whether you have made an error in syntax.

### TablePlus:
* TablePlus is a graphical interface to a range of RDBMS brands. It is capable of connecting to and displaying databases written in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite, among others. 
* The interface can be adapted to different themes. The connection between the front end and your database is encrypted and you can also apply multi-level authentication to access the application. Although ease of use of the graphical user interface makes database exploration a task that non-technical staff could use, this isnâ€™t intended as an end-user tool. It is a support facility for developers and DBAs. The SQL assistant built into the tool is an assistant to trained programmers rather than an automated script generator for untrained staff.
* The data browser reads in records from a selected table, enabling you to view, edit, or delete them. An SQL editor helps you to develop scripts through color-coded statement and clause recognition. This editor includes statement formatting and an autocomplete feature. A data management function enables you to export a database including its data and import that data back again. This is a useful assistant for backup and recovery procedures.

### GraphDB:
* GraphDB is a graphical database that comes with both cloud and on-premise deployment options. It offers features such as data repositories, textual analytics, and knowledge graphs.
* The tool can be used to tag and analyze textual data semantically based on keywords and topics or concepts. The tagged data can then be visualized as knowledge graphs to search and find relationships between disparate data.
