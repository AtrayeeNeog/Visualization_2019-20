### Agenda:

* Discussing the last week's Progress
* Discussing all the measurements for the question one graphs
* Discussing our approach for the question 2 and how to go forward with it
* Discussing the similarity measures and achieved results and conclusions
*

### Progress:

* Literature review was done and some books and papers and tutorials were found
* A presentation showing all the measurements with visualizations was presented
* Histograms were replace by distribution curves and were created for all the measures
* All the graphs of question 1 were compared to Template with Wasserstein metric
* Different channels of all the graphs of question 1 were compared to Template with Wasserstein metric
* The visualization for all the graphs and Template was presented
* Parallel Coordinates for all the graphs was presented
* Our conclusion for question 1 was given and discussed
* The procedure for creating the graphs from seeds of question 2 was presented and discussed
* The goodness of the seeds were presented
* Agenda for the next meeting(in two weeks) was discussed
*

### What next?

* Further Literature review
* Plot Parallel Coordinates have to be discussed and changed.
* Work on Adjacency Matrix for each channel for comparison and analysis.
* More measurements need to be compared for question 1
* Clustering of the network should be decided
* continue with qustion 2 and seeds and work on the big graph (find an stopping criteria)
* Explore each channel separately for measures

### Next Meeting's agenda(May, 27th, 1pm)?

* Discussing our progress for the weekly
* Discussing possible solutions
