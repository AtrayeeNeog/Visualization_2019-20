### Agenda:

* Discussing the last week's Progress
* Discussing all the measurements for the question one graphs
* Discussing our approach for the question 2 and how to go forward with it
* Discussing the similarity measures and achieved results and conclusions
*

### Progress:

* Literature review was done and some books and papers and tutorials were found
* A presentation showing all the measurements with visualizations was presented
* Histograms were replace by distribution curves and were created for all the measures
* All the graphs of question 1 were compared to Template with Wasserstein metric
* Different channels of all the graphs of question 1 were compared to Template with Wasserstein metric
* The visualization for all the graphs and Template was presented
* Parallel Coordinates for all the graphs was presented
* Our conclusion for question 1 was given and discussed
* The procedure for creating the graphs from seeds of question 2 was presented and discussed
* The goodness of the seeds were presented
* Agenda for the next meeting(in two weeks) was discussed


### What next?

* Further Literature review
* Dynamic time warping needs to be researched
* The p-values need to be recalculated and compared
* All the comparisons should come as a whole graphs (to check for the majority voting)
* continue with question 2 and seeds with other measures and more adjustments
* Read the Literature for understanding and clustering the Parallel coordinates

### Next Meeting's agenda(May, 27th, 1pm)?

* Discussing our progress for the weekly
* Discussing possible solutions
