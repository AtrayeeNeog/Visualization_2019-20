### RazorSQL

>* RazorSQL is an extensive suite of tools that will help you run a relational database that is accessed with SQL. 
The suite is able to communicate with a long list of RDBMSs, including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Informix, and Ingres.
The interoperability of the tool is particularly useful if you have to deal with several database types on your site. 
The SQL command set is not exactly the same for all RDBMSs, so you can waste time entering the wrong command format when you switch from one system to another. 
RazorSQL presents a GUI interface, which it then interprets into commands that get executed in the database. 
However, if you want to write your own scripts, the utility includes an SQL Editor, which will highlight syntax errors.
