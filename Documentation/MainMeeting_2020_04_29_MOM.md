### Agenda:

* Discussing the last week's Progress
* Discuss about the data structure
* Discuss about the tools and procedure going forward
* Present some of the teams finding
* Present and discuss time in the data and Parallel coordinates

### Progress:

* A presentation explaining the whole datasets has been presented
* Question 1 was discussed in details
* Template file and Graph data in question were discussed and analyzed in R and Python
* Data division into sub-channels were discussed further
* Parallel coordinates plotted for Template and the Subgraphs were discussed and some issues were identified
* Data plotted against time was discussed and issues were identified
* keywords were discussed for further research
* Probability of ignoring one or more channels or edges based on predefined Weights were discussed
* Agenda for the next meeting(in two weeks) was discussed


### What next?

* Literature Review on:
>* How to find patterns in a network graphs
>* Qualitative graph analysis tools
>* Graph comparison tools
>* Wasserstein distance(metric)
* Add explanations to the codes
* Focus on question-1 first

* Visualization diagrams need to be assessed:
>* Node-Link Diagrams for Hierarchy Visualization (Multilevel Network)
>* Decision Trees
>* Force Directed Node Link Diagrams
>* Stratify the Data Visualization into Panels.
>* Hierarchical Visualization <- TreeMap.
* Need to find Packages(libraries) for Graph analysis and comparison:
>* extension of ggplot2
>* Check the Network graphs in D3.j
* Plot Parallel Coordinates for each channel for comparison and analysis.
* Work on Adjacency Matrix for each channel for comparison and analysis.
* Try to find patterns among each channel of the Template along with the Subgraphs.
* Clustering of the network should be assessed

### Next week's agenda?

* Discussing our progress for the weekly
* Discussing possible solutions
