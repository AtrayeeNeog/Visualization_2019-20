Dear VAST Challenge Committee 2020,

My name is S.Behnam Beladi and I alongside my team are working on the first Mini-Challenge. We started analyzing the data and we came across some doubts about it.

We were wondering if you could please clearify our confusion about the datasets.
Here are the questions that we have regarding the datasets:

1. We noticed that there are some Weight values in the travel channel that are -1 and we wanted to see if these values mean that there are no data available or the duration of the travel is unkown or does it have another meaning?
2. The time ends at precisely one year after the first data, does this final date represent the day that the internet outage happen or is the data from some point of time in the past?
3. While exploring the big graph, do we have to assume that different hacker groups are not in contact with each other or is it possible that a group of hackers is connected to another group or the CGCS organization itself? and if they are connected, what determines a separate hacker group?
4. We noticed that phone and email eTypes are mentioned twice in "CGCS-GraphData-Readme.pdf" and once phone eType is 0 and email eType is 1 and another time the other way around. Which one is the correct one and does it make any difference in our ananlysis?
5. We couldn't quite understand the location data in the Travel channel, what does the Target, Source and Target locations, lattitude and longitude represent and how are they connected to each other?
6. Are the Id's for each node unique? Meaning that if there is an Id for a document(publication), could it also be assigned to a person? (we checked the seeds that are given and Target values that are presumably only for documents or items also exist in the Source column, which represent Person's IDs in the Big Graph data) What does this mean?

Thank you very much. I appreciate and look forward to your quick respond. 

Regards,
Behnam Beladi
