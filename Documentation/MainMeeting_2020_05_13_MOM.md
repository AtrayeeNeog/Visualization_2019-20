### Agenda:

* Discussing the last week's Progress
* Discussing Different Graph analysis measurements in R
* Discussing Different Graph analysis measurements in python
* Dynamic Network analysis in Gephi

### Progress:

* Sent the list of questions to the commity
* Literature review was done and some books and papers and tutorials were found
* A presentation comparing different measurements for question 1 graphs were presented
* Template file and Graph data were visualized in graph format
* Bar charts and Histograms for comparison were discussed
* Some channels of big graph data were visualized based on time
* Dynamic networks were discussed and visualized in Gephi
* keywords were discussed for further research
* Agenda for the next meeting(in two weeks) was discussed
* Visualizations were discussed and these points were made:
  * Plot aggregated measures
  * plot density curves insted of Histograms
  * Don't overplot in the same plot for better comprehension
* Some details regarding the question were discussed

### What next?

* Further Literature review
* Plot Parallel Coordinates have to be discussed and changed.
* Work on Adjacency Matrix for each channel for comparison and analysis.
* More measurements need to be compared for question 1
* Clustering of the network should be decided
* continue with qustion 2 and seeds and work on the big graph (find an stopping criteria)
* Explore each channel separately for measures

### Next Meeting's agenda(May, 27th, 1pm)?

* Discussing our progress for the weekly
* Discussing possible solutions
