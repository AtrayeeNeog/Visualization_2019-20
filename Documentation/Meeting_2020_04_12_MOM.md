>* Add discussion to summary: discuss about the weights and -99
>* Partition data based on channel and save it to different csv
>* Research to see different DB/software/tools to separate the data
>* Work on the Template and Q1 data graphs
>* Details about the channel: ranges, no. of unique values, clusters, scatterplots, proportion of the data.
>* How many edges are connected to each node (to find the importance).
>*  Find the weights associated with the edges (to find sporadicity)
>*  Histograms for weights in Demographic and Procurement channels.
