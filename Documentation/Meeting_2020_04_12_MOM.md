
### - Progress:
>* CGCS-GraphData.csv file was loaded with different methods (code in GitHub repository)
>* discussion about the MC1

### - What next?

>* Make a short report till Monday for the next Wednesday's meeting.
>* Add discussion to summary: discuss about the weights and -99
>* Partition data based on channel and save it to different csv
  ..>* Methods for now: R packages and Python packages
>* Research to see different DB/software/tools to load and separate the data in a more efficient way with better and faster access
>* Work on the Template and Q1 data graphs:
  ..>* write the ideas about the approach
  >** find an approach to separate the datasets
  >** check the graph files and compare with the Template file (find the criteria)
  >** find the below mentioned details and write the code in a way that could be reused for the large datasets
  >** Try out Tableau to see if we can make a fast analysis
>* Details about the channel:
  >** ranges, no. of unique values, clusters, scatterplots, proportion of the data.
  >** what to do with the weights
  >** How many edges are connected to each node (to find the importance).
  >** Find the weights associated with the edges (to find sporadicity)
  >** Histograms for weights in Demographic and Procurement channels.
>* Discuss the possibility of Sampling

### - Next Meeting's Agenda:

>** discuss sharing the GitHub repository
>** discuss our finding
>** prepare questions for the Wednesday's meeting
