### Agenda:

* Discussing the last week's Progress
* Discuss about the data structure
* Discuss about the tools and procedure going forward
* Present some of the teams finding

### Progress:

* Short presentation regarding the dataset has been presented
* Large dataset was discussed and Some insight was given regarding the big dataset with Python
* Template file and Graph data in question were discussed an partially analyzed in R and Python
* A short summary for the dataset and the task descriptions created for visualizing.
* Data division into sub-channels for better analysis was discussed
* Income and Expense categories have been extracted for Demographic channel and Weights have been discussed for each category
* Histograms plotted for Weight ranges were discussed
* Parallel coordinates plotted for Template and the Subgraphs were discussed
* Agenda for the next meeting(in two weeks) was discussed


### What next?

* Literature Review on:
>* How to find patterns in a network graphs
>* Qualitative graph analysis tools
>* Graph comparison tools
>* Wasserstein distance(metric)
* Add explanations to the codes
* Focus on question-1 first

* Visualization diagrams need to be assessed:
>* Node-Link Diagrams for Hierarchy Visualization (Multilevel Network)
>* Decision Trees
>* Force Directed Node Link Diagrams
>* Stratify the Data Visualization into Panels.
>* Hierarchical Visualization <- TreeMap.
* Need to find Packages(libraries) for Graph analysis and comparison:
>* extension of ggplot2
>* Check the Network graphs in D3.j
* Plot Parallel Coordinates for each channel for comparison and analysis.
* Work on Adjacency Matrix for each channel for comparison and analysis.
* Try to find patterns among each channel of the Template along with the Subgraphs.
* Clustering of the network should be assessed

### Next week's agenda?

* Discussing our progress for the weekly
* Discussing possible solutions
