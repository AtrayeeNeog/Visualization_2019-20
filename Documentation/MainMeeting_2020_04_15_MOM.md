### - Agenda:
>* Focus on question 1
>* For Graph comparison, find quantitative tools to compare between graph sets (WaterStone Distance method)
>* Visualization diagrams need to be assesed ->
>** NodeLink Diagrams for Hierarachy (Multilevel Network)
>** Decision Trees
>** Force Directed Node Link Diagrams
>** Adjacency Matrices
>** Stratify the Data Visualisation into Panels.
>** Hierarchical Visualisation <- TreeMap.
>** Network D3


### - Progress:

>* Large dataset, Template and Subgraphs have been analysed and visualised (R and Python)
>* Summary for the entire dataset and the task descriptions created for visualising.
>* Data has been divided into subchannels for better analysis
>* Ranges and Unique values of all dimensions have been analysed for each channel
>* Income and Expense categories have been extracted for Demographic channel and Weights have been analysed for each category
>* Histograms plotted for Weight ranges.
>* Parallel coords plotted for Template and the Subgraphs.
>* Next week's agenda was discussed

### - What next?
>* Need to find Packages and Literature for Graph analysis and comparison.
>* Plot Parallel Coordinates for each channel for comparison and analysis.
>* Work on Adjacency Matrix for each channel for comparison and analysis.
>* Try to find patterns among each channel of the Template along with the Subgraphs.

### - Next week's agenda?

>* Discussing our progress for the weekly
>* Discussing possible solutions
