## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
Graph_Attributes<-data.table::fread(here::here("data", "CGCS-GraphData-NodeTypes.csv"))
s1 <- data.table::fread(here::here("dataQ2","dfSeed1Reduced.csv"))
s3 <- data.table::fread(here::here("dataQ2","dfSeed3Reduced.csv"))
s1_network <- subset(s1, select = c(Source, Target, Weight))
s3_network <- subset(s3, select = c(Source, Target, Weight))
s1_edgelist <- s1_network
s1_graph <- graph.data.frame(s1_edgelist, directed = TRUE)

s3_edgelist <- s3_network
s3_graph <- graph.data.frame(s3_edgelist, directed = TRUE)

s1_graph2<-igraph::simplify(s1_graph, remove.multiple = FALSE, remove.loops = TRUE)
s3_graph2<-igraph::simplify(s3_graph, remove.multiple = FALSE, remove.loops = TRUE)

tail(s1, 10)
unique(Graph_Attributes$NodeType)
```

## S1:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#Layout Options
set.seed(3952)  # set seed to make the layout reproducible
#layout1 <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(s1_graph, niter=1000) #Creating a layout object to tell iGraph what layout I want
layout1 <-layout_in_circle(s1_graph2)
V(s1_graph2)

#Node or Vetex Options: Size and Color
#colrs <- c("gray50", "tomato", "gold")
#V(s1_graph2)$color <- colrs[V(s1_graph2)$media.type]
#NodeType	Description
#  1	      Person
#  2	  Product category
#  3	      Document
#  4	  Financial category
#  5	      Country

V(s1_graph2)$color <- ifelse(Graph_Attributes[V(s1_graph2), 2] == 1, "tomato", 
                              ifelse(Graph1_Attributes[V(s1_graph2), 2] == 4, "gray50",
                                    ifelse(Graph1_Attributes[V(s1_graph2), 2] == 5, "gold", "green")))

#V(s1_graph2)$size <- V(s1_graph2)$Weight 

#Edge Options: Color
E(s1_graph2)$color <- "grey"

#Plotting, Now Specifying an arrow size and getting rid of arrow heads
#We are letting the color and the size of the node indicate the directed nature of the graph
plot(s1_graph2, edge.arrow.size=0.25,edge.arrow.mode = "-", vertex.label = NA, layout=layout1)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
