## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load The Data:
seed1 <- data.table::fread(here::here("data", "extractedSeeds", "Seed1-Graph2NonCom.csv"))
seed1_2 <- seed1 %>% filter(seed1$eType==2)
seed1_3 <- seed1 %>% filter(seed1$eType==3)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
items_sold <- count(seed1_2, c("Source","Target")) # Trying to find interesting items which were sold multiple times.
items_bought <- count(seed1_3, c("Source","Target")) # Trying to find interesting items which were bought multiple times.
# We need items which are sold and bought more than 7 times by the same people.

max(items_sold$freq)
min(items_sold$freq)
max(items_bought$freq)
min(items_bought$freq)
unique(items_sold$freq)

items_sold <- items_sold %>% filter(items_sold$freq >= 7)
items_bought <- items_bought %>% filter(items_bought$freq >= 7)
```

```{r}
## Items which are both sold and bought more than 7 times:
frequent_items<-intersect(items_sold$Target, items_bought$Target)
```

```{r}
trans <- seed1[seed1$Target==547205]
ggplot(trans, aes(x=as.character(Source), y=Time, color = as.character(eType), fill=as.character(eType))) + 
  geom_point(shape=23, size = 5)+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=10, angle=90))+labs(title="Source Target Combinations for Big Graph ",
                                    x="Source & Target Combination", y = "Time")
```

```{r}
trans <- seed1[seed1$Target==469675]
ggplot(trans, aes(x=as.character(Source), y=Time, color = as.character(eType), fill=as.character(eType))) + 
  geom_point(shape=23, size = 5)+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=10, angle=90))+labs(title="Source Target Combinations for Big Graph ",
                                    x="Source & Target Combination", y = "Time")
```

```{r}
trans <- seed1[seed1$Target==461577]
ggplot(trans, aes(x=as.character(Source), y=Time, color = as.character(eType), fill=as.character(eType))) + 
  geom_point(shape=23, size = 5)+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=10, angle=90))+labs(title="Source Target Combinations for Big Graph ",
                                    x="Source & Target Combination", y = "Time")
```
